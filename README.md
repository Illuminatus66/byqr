# WHAT

Online marketplace called "BYQR" for comparing and buying bicycles.
AR visualization of bicycles planned as a last resort in case some other USP does not come to mind. 
AR feature subject to availability of good imaging tech and compute resources

# HOW

Built using React Native without any framework. 
Initial development will focus on building for medium-sized Android phones.
Further planning for iOS devices after first stage of development

# WHY

No unified marketplace for cycling enthusiasts and eco/health conscious people. 
Branding focuses on targeting a niche market but will be accessible to a wider population due to affordability.
Growing need for reducing congestion in first and second tier cities 


## This is a tentative README and it will be updated with build instructions once the application is developed in it's entirety.
